# v0.1 — Private preview showcase

**Status: complete.** Tagged as v0.1.0. Signed installers + hosted LLM providers land in v0.2.

The goal of v0.1 was to ship the platform thesis end-to-end against synthetic + real Graph data, so prospective users can evaluate the trust story, the agent template DSL, and the path from "describe what you want" to "agent running on your tenant." Every promise the marketing page makes about local-first, transparency, and human-in-the-loop has a corresponding feature in the desktop app.

## What landed

### Platform
- [x] Electron desktop app (Windows + macOS in dev; signed builds in v0.2)
- [x] Vite + React + React Router renderer
- [x] Tailwind design system ported from `docs/mockups/_design.css`
- [x] MSAL interactive authorization-code + PKCE tenant connect against the public Microsoft Graph CLI client
- [x] Encrypted token cache via Electron `safeStorage`
- [x] Ollama local LLM provider with NDJSON streaming + thinking display
- [x] Synthetic Graph fixture as the default data source
- [x] Real Graph adapter for `/deviceManagement/managedDevices` (GET + paging + retry)
- [x] Real Graph writes gated behind tenant-connected + global toggle

### Agent Templates (the DSL)
- [x] `descriptor`, `skills[]`, `definition` shape backed by SDK types
- [x] Liquid-subset templating with `size`, `total`, `length`, `sample`, `default`, `join`, `upper`, `lower`, `type`
- [x] Step formats: `graph`, `transform`, `llm`, `write`
- [x] Transform kinds: `group-by-age`, `filter-by-age`, `count-by-field`
- [x] Write action handlers: `retire-managed-device`
- [x] Install-time settings (integer / string / boolean) — UI + persistence + runtime merge
- [x] JSON Schema (`schemas/agent-template.schema.json`) — editor autocomplete + CI validation
- [x] Manifest Preview component renders pipeline cards, scopes, raw YAML, settings (default + current)

### NL2Agent
- [x] `draftAgentManifest(prompt)` — structured prompt + schema + worked example, parses + validates
- [x] `saveAgentDraft(yaml)` — writes to `userData/agents/<slug>/`
- [x] Two-pane modal flow on the hub: prompt → review → save & install
- [x] Validation errors surfaced inline with raw-YAML disclosure
- [x] User-authored agents stamped with absolute `registryPath` so they coexist with bundled agents

### Reference agents
- [x] `find-inactive-devices` (devices, read) — group-by-age + LLM polish
- [x] `retire-inactive-devices` (devices, write) — filter-by-age + write step + typed confirmation
- [x] `compliance-overview` (compliance, read) — count-by-field with pinned buckets
- [x] `os-update-posture` (updates, read) — two count-by-fields side by side

### QA + CI
- [x] `npm run qa` validates: schema, declared scopes against `merill/msgraph`, endpoint existence, select fields, fixture coverage
- [x] GitHub Actions CI on push + PR: typecheck + qa + build
- [x] All checks green; signed status badge ready for v0.2 installer signing

## What's deferred to v0.2

- Hosted LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI) — adapter stubs exist, real wiring + secret storage land with `keytar`
- LM Studio local provider — same shape as Ollama, separate adapter
- Signed installers (Windows EV cert + Apple notarization)
- Auto-update via `electron-updater` against signed GitHub releases
- SQLite migration for run history (currently JSON-backed)
- Scheduled triggers (`triggers[].kind: scheduled`) — manifest already declares them; interpreter only honours manual today

## How to run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck && npm run qa && npm run build
```
